    <h1>See Below for Examples!</h1>
    <p>To make a new line, use the "< br >" tag.</p>
    <p>To <em>italicize</em> font, use the "< em > &< /em >" tags</p>
    <p>To <strong>bold</strong> text, use the "< strong >< /strong > tags</p>
    <p>Lists are a <em>bit</em> more tricky. You'll need to put the list within UL tags and then each <br>
        item will be wrapped in LI tags. The UL will make an unorganized (aka a bulleted list), while <br>
        the OL tag will make a numbered list. See the lists below!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ol>
    <p>The formatting for images is a bit different since we can load multiple tags within one tag.<br>
        Images open with "< img src = "" >" but there is not a closing tag for IMG. The path to the <br>
        image goes within the quotes and then it can be followed by "alt="" " to show alternative text <br>
        that can be used by screen readers. You can finally specify a height or a width, but you <br>
        shouldn't do both. You do that by typing either height or width = and then a number <br>
        (ex height = "50").<br>
